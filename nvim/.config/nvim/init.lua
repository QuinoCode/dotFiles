    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
vim.g.mapleader = ' '
vim.g.maplocalleader = ' '

-- Set to true if you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in the terminal
vim.g.have_nerd_font = true

vim.cmd.colorscheme('darktooth')

require 'options'

require 'keymaps'

require 'lazy-bootstrap'

require 'plugins-lazy'
